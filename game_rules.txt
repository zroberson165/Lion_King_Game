Aidan and Zach's Wonderful Game of Life Ripoff Rules:
Each Player picks a path, either Pride Lands or Cub Training
If they pick Cub Training, they will pick an advisor up front
Dont worry, you can still find advisors in the Pride Lands!
Advisors will offer ability to escape dangerous situations and provide more stat/point gains
Pride Lands offers upfront gains, with less chance of long term gains
Training offers less upfront gains, with more chance of long term gains
However, training means more time passes, and more threats are present!
Will add more rules when we know what we want to do.
